# dccon

The script lets you download a whole 디시콘(dccon) package.

Every dccon has an index which can be checked by clicking it on the shop.
(e.g. 18300 in [너의 이름은콘2](http://dccon.dcinside.com/hot/3#18300))
Just use `quick(idx)` to download it at the current path.
A folder is created with the same name as the package, including JSON package information, download logs, dccon images.
